    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-text"> <p>
      With the title WORK, BODY, LEISURE, the Dutch Pavilion at the 16th International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia addresses the spatial configurations, modes of living and notions of the human body engendered by disruptive changes in labor ethos and conditions. The project, commissioned by Het Nieuwe Instituut and curated by Marina Otero Verzier, includes contributions by a group of architects, artists, designers, historians, musicians and theorists selected by the curatorial team and through a number of open calls. This collaborative endeavor seeks to foster new forms of creativity and responsibility within the architectural field in response to emerging technologies of automation. A domain of research and innovation that, despite its ongoing transformation of the built environment and bodies that inhabit it, is still largely devoid of a critical spatial perspective. <br><br> <strong>This website serves as an introduction to a few of the exhibits which will be found at the show. It's by no means comprehensive, but instead serves as a guide to give background insight and encourage exploration of the subjects examined by the pavilion. </strong>

    <div class="inner-subheader">
      <p>"The locker is the interface between this moment and these other different architectures. It's a space that is completely organised and compartmentalised. You have an egalitarian society but in some sense it is very constrained."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-text"> <p>
      The lockers in the exhibition chart a journey through a series of architectures in the Netherlands and beyond in which bodies are categorized and transformed: offices, playgrounds, farms, factories and virtual spaces, windows, beds, and doors. Scenarios that look familiar—if rarely accessible or seemingly banal—but are nevertheless at the epicenter of the transformation of labor.

    <h2>#BED</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-subheader">
      <p> Princeton University professor Beatriz Colomina has created an installation called Bed-In, which recreates the "fucktory" of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's bed in Room 902 of the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel. Her aim was to show how the bed is now a place of work as well as sleep.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-text"> <p>
In today’s attention-deficit-disorder society, we have discovered that we work better in short bursts punctuated by rest. Many companies provide sleeping pods in the office to maximize productivity. Bed and office are never far apart in the 24/7 world. Special self-enclosed beds have been designed for office spaces—turning themselves into compact sealed capsules, mini space ships, that can be used in isolation, gathered together in clusters, or lined up in rows for synchronized sleep—understood as a part of work rather than its opposite.<br><br> Between the bed in the office and the office in the bed, a whole new horizontal architecture has taken over. It is magnified by the “flat” networks of social media that have themselves become fully integrated into professional, business, and industrial environments in a collapse of traditional distinctions between private and public, work and play, rest and action. The bed today has become a portable universe, equipped with every possible technology of communication. A midcentury fantasy has turned into mass reality.

      <p>"How a world is shaped by memory." - Sara Ahmed </p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-text"> <p>
      Curator, cultural programmer and radio host Amal Alhaag focuses in her essay for the publication Work, Body, Leisure on the Door(s) of No Return, an architectural symbol of the slavery and colonialism, and looks into the historical significance and implications in the present. <br>
      This essay is merely scratching the surface of the research, (un)thinking, literature, and cultural production examining the complex genealogy and sets of relations, histories, and politics that inform the project Technologies of Certain Bodies. <br> <br>It is an invitation to complicate, and trace the technologies of certain bodies by invoking the historical and architectural function—meaning the politics and poetics—of the Door(s) of no Return at Fort Elmina, Cape Coast, and the island of Gorée in West Africa in order to question the process by which ethnographic, enslaved, migratory, and gendered people are reduced to bodies by technology. The project is also a proposition to be “in the wake,” and to vigilantly question the engineering of the enslaved African bodies as historical sites for technological innovation of work, body, and leisure. <br> <br> In what ways do these specific bodies redefine and resist the dominant hegemonic understandings of technology, space, memory, and the body itself? Equally, what does it mean to talk about work, leisure, and the body in the wake of, and amidst the ongoing trauma of African deaths in the Mediterranean Sea?

      <p>A contemporary cover album of work and protest songs from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries serves as the soundtrack for the Dutch pavilion. The songs provide a historical context for the nature of today’s labor and connect past but enduring struggles with contemporary debates regarding the effects of industrialization and automation on the working body. Songs for Hard Working People is also a tribute to all the workers involved in the production, construction, and maintenance of the Biennale and who remain largely invisible.</p>

      <p>Liam Young has emerged as one of the most distinctive and adventurous voices in contemporary architecture. At the core of his multidisciplinary practice is a continuous interrogation of the present realities of cities and the extrapolation and exaggeration of existing networks, systems, and technologies to imagine possible future urbanisms. While storytelling, documentary film, and multimedia performance have been central to Young’s practice, the exhibition reveals his emerging engagement with narrative film as an architectural medium and his ground-breaking experimentation with new technologies as cinematic tools.</p>

      <div class="inner-text">
        <p>The incursion of artificial intelligence and full automation into workspaces and productive landscapes has been recently designated the trigger for major shifts in manual labour, white-collar and service-sector work, and a key driver in job losses and declining wages. Under the premise that automation disrupts not only labour markets, but the configuration, design and occupation of entire territories, ‘Automated Landscapes’ seeks to document and reflect upon the emerging architectures and urbanisms of fully-automated labour, looking at other actors involved in the production of spaces that remain beyond classic notions of authorship and signature.<p>

        <p>As part of the Extended Program of the Dutch Pavilion of the Biennale Architettura 2018, the Institute of Patent Infringement is launching an Open Call encouraging students, architects, urban planners, designers, artists, programmers and others interested to reimagine, infringe and hack existing Amazon patents.</p>      </div>
      <div class="inner-text">
        <p>Within WORK, BODY, LEISURE, the Dutch contribution the Biennale Architettura 2018, Het Nieuwe Instituut and Creative Industries Fund NL jointly organized an Open Call in Autumn 2017 to support designers and advance knowledge in the field of architecture before, during and after the Biennial. Applicants were asked to submit a project proposal reflecting upon and responding to the theme of the Dutch Pavilion, as part of its extended program. The Institute of Patent Infringement was one of the five projects awarded by the advisory committee.<br><br>
        The satirical Institute of Patent Infringement aims to dissect the dubious world of intellectual property rights that allows 'Big Tech' multinationals a monopoly on ideas concerning automation. The project unveils the future of technical innovations imagined and designed by Amazon by detailing and organising thousands of patents filed since 2010, ranging in scale from the body to the 1km2 fulfilment centre. An open call invites practitioners to merge, reimagine and subvert these patent drawings, revealing a possible radical and emancipatory potential inherent in these technological regimes, as well as a space where architecture can play a role in this.</p>
