        <h2> <div id="artist">ARTISTA:</div> Smash Mouth</h2>
        <div id="bio">

          <p1>Smash Mouth’s best known song, with part of its enduring popularity/infamy caused by its inclusion in the opening scene of Shrek. And yet the music video is a tie-in to another film, 1999’s Mystery Men.

            On “All Star,” Smash Mouth takes us through the simple, action-oriented philosophy of a dumb but aggressively upbeat narrator.

            Smash Mouth may have been offering an arch commentary on this quintessentially American (and Californian) philosophy. Maybe they saw some of this narrator in themselves. What is clear, however, is that they have identified this narrator as a loser and idiot, so his philosophy is not to be interpreted as a Smash Mouth lifestyle endorsement. The band’s aim is to present a jolly jester’s worldview, and perhaps comment on the jester himself, but not to advocate that listeners follow this jester. After all, that path leads to delusion, destruction by external environmental factors, and flaming out as quickly as a shooting star.

                      You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older<br>
