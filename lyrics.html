    <p>
    Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<br>
    <p>

    <a href="#pre-chorus">Pre-Chorus</a><br>
    <p>
    Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
    So much to do, so much to see<br>
    So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br>
    You'll never know if you don't go<br>
    You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
    <p>

    Hey now you're an All Star, get your game on, go play<br>
    Hey now you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid<br>
    And all that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
    <p>

    It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder<br>
    You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older<br>
    But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
    My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored<br>
    <p>

    Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?<br>
    "I need to get myself away from this place"<br>
    I said "Yep, what a concept<br>
    I could use a little fuel myself<br>
    And we could all use a little change!"<br>
